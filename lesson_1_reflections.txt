What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use log to find out which two versions to compare, and diff to see the
    changes made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
